      <h1>Version Control System:GIT</h1>
      <p>Why Version control?
      You're going to be working on a long project so you might difinitely make mistakes.
      Or you might also want to experiment.
      How do we do that safely?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By using GIT.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="detail">
      <h2>GIT CONFIG</h2>
      <p>The first thing to do is to configure Git with a couple of pieces of information it's going to need later.</p>
      <div id="git-config">%git config --global user.email sodaba.bashiri@powercoders.org<br>
      %git config --global user.name "Sodaba Bashiri"</div>
      <p>So run these two commands, using your e-mail address and name.</p>

      <h2>Git fundamentals</h2>
      <p>There are three locations that GIT commands files to be copied between them:
        <ol>
          <li>Working directory</li>
          <li>Index</li>
          <li>Repository</li>
        </ol></p>

      <h2>Typical Git workflow</h2>
      <p><strong>Git init</strong>- Git needs to know hwere the top, or root, of
      the repository is going to be. Once you do it with git init,  Git can
      start to manage all the files in that directory, and all the directories below.
      You can have multiple Git repositories on your computer, as long as they
      are not inside one another.</p>

      <p><strong>Git add</strong>- When you're done with the file you're working on, you copy it to the index using git add.</p>

      <p><strong>Git commit</strong>- When you've double checked your file in the index and you're sure to save it to the repository,, you use git commit.</p>

      <div id="git-commit">% git commit -m "Save first version of file."</div>

      <p>- To make a copy of the file, or files, in the index, and save them in the repository we use git commit.

      Git needs us to give a message that is associated with the commit.

      Here, I'm using the -m flag to specify the commit message.

      Don't forget the double quotes.</p>

    </div>

      <p><strong>Git status</strong>- it shows the tracked or untracked files, commited or uncommited files.</p>
      <p>( SIDE NOTE) - the index is sometimes also known as the cache, or stage.
      So as well as reading documentation that talks about adding a changed file to Git you might also see term staged being used.</p>

      <p><strong>Git rm</strong>- If you wanted to remove/delete a file from the index, you use git rm.
      ( This wouldn't delete it from the working directory, just the index.)</p>

      <p><strong>Git log</strong>- Shows you what's changed.</p>

      <p><strong>Git diff</strong>- Once we've made some changes that we want to add to the index it can be helpful to easily view them to double check that they're what we want.For that we use the git diff command.
      This shows the difference between what's in the working directory and what's in the index.</p>
