      <h1 align="center">Version Control System:GIT</h1>
      <p>Why Version control?
      <br>You're going to be working on a long project so you might difinitely make mistakes.
      Or you might also want to experiment.
      How do we do that safely?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By using GIT.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="details">
      <h2>GIT CONFIG</h2>

      <p>The first thing to do is to configure Git with a couple of pieces of information it's going to need later.</p>

      <div id="git-config">%git config --global user.email sodaba.bashiri@powercoders.org<br>
      %git config --global user.name "Sodaba Bashiri"</div>

      <p>So run these two commands, using your e-mail address and name.</p>

      <h2>Git fundamentals</h2>
      <p>Git commands copy files between these locations:
        <ol>
          <li>Working directory</li>
          <li>Index</li>
          <li>Repository</li>
        </ol></p>

      <h2>Typical Git workflow</h2>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Git init</strong></span> - Git needs to know where the top, or root, of
      the repository is going to be. Once you do it with git init,  Git can
      start to manage all the files in that directory, and all the directories below.
      You can have multiple Git repositories on your computer, as long as they
      are not inside one another.</p>

      <div id="git-init">%git init</div>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Git add</strong></span> - When you're done with the file you're working on, you copy it to the index using git add.</p>
      <p><div id="git-add">%git add dir-name

      <br>...

      <br>%git commit -m "Write a message."

      <br>...

      <br>%git push</div></p>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Git commit</strong></span> - When you've double checked your file in the index and you're sure to save it to the repository, you use git commit.</p>
      <p><div class="git-commit">%git commit -m "Write a message."

      <br>...

      <br>%git push</div></p>

      <p>To make a copy of the file, or files, in the index, and save them in the repository we use git commit.
      Git needs us to give a message that is associated with the commit.
      Here, I'm using the -m flag to specify the commit message.
      <span id="doublequotes">Don't forget the double quotes.</span></p>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Git status</strong></span> - it shows the tracked or untracked, commited or uncommited files.</p>
      <div id="git-status">%git status</div>

      <p>( SIDE NOTE) - The index is sometimes also known as the <strong>cache</strong>, or <strong>stage</strong>.
      So as well as reading documentation that talks about adding a changed file to Git, you might also see term staged being used.</p>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Git rm</strong></span> - If you wanted to remove/delete a file from the index, you use git rm.
      ( This wouldn't delete it from the working directory, just the index. So before that, you have to delete the file from the computer.)</p>
      <p><div id="git-rm">%git rm --cached&lt;files&gt;..."
      <br>...
      <br>%git commit -m "Write a message."</div></p>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Git log</strong></span> - Shows you what's changed.</p>
      <div id="git-log">%git log</div>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Git diff</strong></span> - Once we've made some changes that we want
        to add to the index, it can be helpful to easily view them to double
        check that they're what we want. For that we use the git diff command.</p>
      <p>This shows the difference between what's in the working directory and
        what's in the index. If it didn't find any file in the index, it
        compares with the file in the repository.</p>
      <div id="git-diff">%git diff</div>

      <p><span class="big-font"><strong>Unified diff format</strong></span></p>

      <h2>Distributed version control (DVCS)</h2>
      <p>So far your version control repository is only stored on your computer.
        Distributed version control was invented for teams of programmers,
        to make it easy for other people on the team to see your changes, maybe
        comment on them, or review them, or learn from them.</p>

      <p>Essentially, this is a way of saying that two or more different repositories are linked together.
        Once they're linked together there are commands to manage copying commits
        from one repository to another. And lots of tools exist to let you see
        the repository in a web browser, view the commits, give feedback, and so on.</p>

      <p>Various companies exist that provide online hosting for copies of your
        repositories, including <a href="www.github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="www.gitlab.com">GitLab</a>, <a href="www.bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>, and more.
        But we're going to use GitHub.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Looks like https://github.com/user/poco-yourname.git</li>
            </ul>
          <li>git remote add origin https://github.com/user/poco-yourname.git</li>
          <li>git remote -v to view configured remotes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In Git terminology, copies of your repository that are stored
          elsewhere, like on GitHub, are called remotes.</p>

          <p>To tell your local repository about these we use the git remote add command.
          It needs to know the URL to the remote repository. For GitHub it's
          going to look like this URL here. Replace the user in the URL with
          the username that you chose when you signed up to Git, and the last
          part is poco.git because we called the repository poco.</p>

          <p>This is also the URL for the repository in the browser, with .git
          added to the end, so you can cut and paste.</p>

          <p>The origin in the command is the short-name that we're going to use for the remote.
          You can use anything you want. However, the convention in Git is that
          the public version of the repository is called origin</p>

          <li>git push - after that</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that that your local repository is configured to sync with the
          repository on GitHub we can copy all of our commits so far to the
          copy of the repository on GitHub.</p>
        <p>To do that, run the git push command.</p>
        <p>The very first time we do this we have to tell Git exactly how these two repositories are linked, including how they branch.
          You will probably be prompted for the password for your GitHub account.</p>
